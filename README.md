Hello there :wave:  
Hope You all have enjoyed the workshop and ready to contribute to open source. These resources will help you get up and going with Git and GitHub. Before we get started read our community blog on [How Open Source can help shape your IT career](https://sosc.org.in/blog/how-open-source-can-shape-your-it-career)

## Installation
If you are a Windows user. Please download the following application to use the terminal in windows.
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Or enable Windows SubSystem for Linux and follow the instructions for Linux systems.

For installing git on Ubuntu
```
$ sudo apt install git
```
After finishing the installation, run the following commands to configure the global user info for git on your computer.
```sh
$ git config --global user.name "Your github username here"
```
```sh
$ git config --global user.email "Your email here"
```

### Install a Favorite editor of your choice :computer:
You can install any of your favorite editor to start working on projects. I strongly recommend using VSCode, since it got a lot of Git integrations and plugins to help.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com)
